# IGF Awards Nominees 2025

When the IGF released their nominees for this year’s Indie Game Festival Awards, I was curious to see what had been going on in the space and wanted to make a list of possible titles for (primarily for my son, as well as myself, to play). However, all the news stories I found had the same list, all without *links* to the websites, Steam pages, or other place where readers could actually read about, download, play, or (importantly) pay for the games nominated.

There’s probably somewhere out there that you can get the links, but I saw an opportunity to contribute and share, so below you’ll find the exact list I’ve seen on several site, but with clickable links that take you (mostly) to each game’s Steam page. There are also a few Itch.io pages and one Meta link.

Enjoy. And support indie development!
