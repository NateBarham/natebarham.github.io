While rebuilding BarhamInk.com, I came across the now defunct podcast *Critically Speaking* which I hosted with Scott Boren. The full 42 episode run of the show is still available at [ShoutEngine](http://shoutengine.com/CriticallySpeaking/) if for some reason, you're interested in listening.

The premise has us taking on a piece of videogames journalism each week, looking for meaning and providing commentary on the state of the industry. In addition, we talk about our current obsessions in gaming and generally laugh and have a good time.

Looking back, each episode has components that are evergreen and some that are very dated. Scott is hilarious and worth a listen just for his spontaneous accents, and the recording production quality is quite high, mostly thanks to our producer/editor Ryan Taylor.

Take the trip down memory lane at your own (quite minimal) risk.
