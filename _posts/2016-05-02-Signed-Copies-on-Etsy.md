Starting this week (yesterday, actually) signed, hand wrapped copies of <i>Fragments</i>&nbsp;and <i>The Elf and the Arrow</i> are again available for purchase, now through the Barham Ink shop on Etsy. Prior sales went through a different provider which meant higher prices and shipping costs, and that only one book or the other  could be offered for sale at any given time.

The new shop and Etsy's sales policy allow prices to be lower than ever without reducing the amount each sale generates toward production on the next book. Shipping is also cheaper and more accurate thanks to Etsy's automatically calculated shipping.
