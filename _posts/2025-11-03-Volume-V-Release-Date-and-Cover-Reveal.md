After seven long years of work, the next volume in the *Alora‚Äôs Tear* series is finally ready! For those who prefer paperbacks, I‚Äôll have the first copies available at the [CHS Craft Fair on November 15th](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/16tbNkxXjP/), and later in Moscow at the [Winter Market](https://www.1912center.org/wintermarket1.php) in December.

If you‚Äôre in the neighborhood, stop by, say hello, and pick up what has been by far the hardest book I‚Äôve had to write. I can‚Äôt wait to see you.

If you can‚Äôt make it to either event, please order from [the Etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/barhamink/?etsrc=sdt) (where I can sign them before I send them to you) or ask [BookPeople of Moscow](https://bookpeopleofmoscow.com/) about the series.

> The book will be available on Amazon, but I humbly ask that, if you are able, to avoid purchasing it there. Copies sold on Amazon must be priced higher than other options only for me to receive slightly more than **one dollar (!) per sale**. If you live nearby, I would honestly prefer to drive a copy to your house myself. üòÇ

For those who prefer digital, you will be able to find *The Glittering World* on Apple Books, Kobo, and Kindle.

Below, you‚Äôll find‚Äîonce again‚Äîthe masterful artwork of Isis Sousa portraying not only the cover‚Äôs featured character, Elise, but also a look at the Glittering World itself. Isis has outdone herself again. I am in love with this cover art, and I know you will be too. In a 2025 where human creativity and artistry are continuously devalued by ‚Äúai‚Äù, it was an absolute joy to contribute to the creation of something beautiful alongside a skillful master.

Please enjoy the back cover text as well, unless you‚Äôre like me and prefer to wait to let the book tell its story on its own terms.

## A Growing Darkness in a World of Lights

On the rim of the Cold Valley shine stars enough for two skies; one above and one below. The Breaker and the Mender reach out to one another across the clouds while a splay of constellations encircle their everlasting dance. But, the second set are no stars at all. They are the thousands upon uncountable thousand lights of a city so great it encompasses all the world Askon has ever known. Somewhere in that city is the woman from the visions, somewhere in that city is Alora.  
  
They all know it now to be true. Finding her is a matter of only where, and when.  
  
None knows it better than Elise, her mind filled with fading images of Thomas‚Äôs face, stricken and wild as they dragged him away. She will chew the shadow of herself down to nothing to find him. Each step, each overturned stone brings her closer to the final confrontation with the one who took him from her, the one who hurt him: Sehl√≠n.  
  
Elsewhere, the stars shine on, over Edward king of Vladvir, over John of Dalstone, over sable-gray falcon wings, and Dansil of Finnestre. When the sun rises, an army of Norill will gather, their mouths silent, their hands set singly upon the commands of a cruel master, whose eyes watch as daybreak washes over the Glittering World.
