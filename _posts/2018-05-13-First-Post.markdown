Starting a new website is quite the difficult challenge when also working on a new book, but I think that the revamp will be worth the effort in the end.

First and foremost, the new solution is free. And though I love Squarespace. I think it’s time that I own the content that I’m producing on a broader level. That means designing the site, knowing its ins and outs, and hosting it.

Also, I’d like the site to be fast (one of the major drawbacks of Squarespace, IMO). The best way to do that is with a static site like the new BarhamInk.com and [unlike Think Critical][1] and the old BarhamInk.com which were hosted on Tumblr and Squarespace, respectively.
