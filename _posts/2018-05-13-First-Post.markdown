Starting a new website is quite the difficult challenge when also working on a new book, but I think that the revamp will be worth the effort in the end.

First and foremost, it is free. And though I love Squarespace. I think it’s time that own the content that I’m producing—from soup to nuts. That means designing the site, knowing its ins and outs, and hosting it.

Also, I’d like the site to be fast (one of the major drawbacks of Squarespace, IMO). The best way to do that is with a static site ([unlike this one][1]).

Update: I have to make sure that the desktop app will make these.
