As part of the publication process for&nbsp;<em><a href="/vol-2">The Elf and the Arrow</a>,&nbsp;</em>one of my goals was to simplify and streamline the publication processâ€”especially when it comes to the eBook version. When <em><a href="/buy-the-book">Fragments</a> </em>was published, I had racked up an unacceptable amount of time spent tinkering with HTML in <a href="https://code.google.com/p/sigil/?utm_source=hootsuite">Sigil</a> or <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">Text Wrangler</a>&nbsp;in hopes that I could get the digital version of the book looking just the way I wanted it. In the end, even after days of reading and rewriting code for the eBook, the final product still fell short of my intent. I still think the digital versions of&nbsp;<em>Fragments&nbsp;</em>are the best I could possibly make at the time, and I stand by them, taking pride in the final product.

However, Volume II is a different day and a different project and a (slightly) different me. Over at my tech and gaming blog, <a href="http://natebarham.com">Think Critical</a>, I wrote a review for a stellar (and wonderfully affordable) piece of software called <a href="https://180g.co/vellum/">Vellum</a> that has made production on the eBook version of&nbsp;<em>The Elf and the Arrow</em>&nbsp;a pleasure. If you're interested in self-publishing, or creative and well-made software in general, <a href="http://natebarham.com/post/111955485472/recommended-vellum">I suggest you check it out</a>.

More soon on Volume II. It's closer than you might think.
