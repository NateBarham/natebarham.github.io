This week, I was lucky enough to be a guest on <a href="https://podcast.brooksreview.net">The Brooks Review</a><a href="https://podcast.brooksreview.net"> podcast</a>. Ben’s a great host, and I was delighted to be on the show. We talked mostly about the self-publishing process, some of its chief difficulties, and tips for writing framed around my background in secondary education. If you haven’t listened to the show before, it has a lot going for it. I recommend the <a href="https://podcast.brooksreview.net/episode/25">pilot episode</a>, in which Ben describes the direction and philosophy behind it all.

Of course, I’d love it even more if you listened to <a href="https://podcast.brooksreview.net/episode/81">my episode</a>, but that’s just me. And to no one’s surprise, <a href="/buy-the-book">Alora’s Tear</a> gets a mention or two throughout.

Check it out. And remember that with podcasts (as with apps and books) reviews help a great deal. If you like it—and say so in a review—you’d be doing a bigger favor than you might think.
