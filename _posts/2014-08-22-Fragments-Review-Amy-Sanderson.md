Over on her wonderfully titled blog, <a href="http://amysanderson.co.uk">Not All Those Who Wander</a>, Amy Sanderson (author of <a href="http://amysanderson.co.uk/sanguine/">Sanguine</a>) posted what—to my knowledge—is the first public review of <a href="/buy-the-book">Fragments</a>.

Check it out. It's always exciting to see feedback from readers. I hope that Amy is just the first of many. Not only is it a great feeling to see what people think of Askon's adventure, every time someone rates or reviews the book, it helps the audience grow. So, thanks to Amy and thanks to all the future reviewers that are out there enjoying (I sincerely hope) the story right now.
