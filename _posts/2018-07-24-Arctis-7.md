## Overview

We’ve been told time and again in the world of technology that the future is wireless. I recently elected to join that future in my current PC gaming setup with the [Steelseries Arctis 7](https://amzn.to/2Jlt8w9) headset. These headphones boast the same hardware as the more expensive *pro* model by Steelseries, a high quality retractable microphone, and lag-free audio in a subtle design that is free of the multicolored lights and faux robotic parts that mark most gaming peripherals.

## Comfort

The Arctis 7 marketing touts the ski-goggle strap headband adjustment system for ultimate comfort. In my use, this is a fine way to adjust the headband, but in practice the metal headband itself is a bit too shallow. Regardless of the nice, infinitely resizable strap, the metal rests against my head when the strap is loose enough for the cups to comfortably cover my ears. Your milage may vary.

The headphones themselves use a fabric similar to modern sports equipment, that makes them more breathable over long gaming sessions. I’ve found this claim mostly true, though I wish the pads were thicker. They stay cool and don’t deteriorate like the fake leather pads on cheaper headphones.
The whole headset is quite light, and meets my primary goal of being more comfortable than my previous pair, the wired [Razer Kraken Pro v2](http://toolsandtoys.net/reviews/a-razer-mega-review-blackwidow-x-tournament-keyboard-deathadder-elite-mouse-and-kraken-pro-7-1-headset/) (a very comfortable set if you’re not interested in wireless).

## Microphone

One of my main complaints with the Kraken Pro v2 was the low quality microphone. I play a lot of Heroes of the Storm and enjoy doing so with the company of friends, strategizing, calling shots, and just generally chatting. The aggressive audio processing, noise gating, and other features never worked properly and without them, the sound was harsh and difficult to effectively tune.

The Arctis 7s claim the best microphone in gaming, and though that specific assertion may not be true, it has been exactly what I was looking for in a mic. My voice sounds more like me, the controls are simple and direct with no black-box *smart* switches or toggles. Best of all, background noise is limited by the hardware itself simply by using good mic technique. There’s a large air conditioner next to my desk that I used to have to shut off if I wanted to be on comms, but now that same unit can kick on and off without any complaints from teammates.

## Sound Quality

In the quality realm, the Arctis 7s struggle a bit. The default configuration lacks bass and soundstage depth. However, the mid and high range are excellent, a very important point if your ear is more attuned to subtleties of sound design in games. What these headphones lack in bass can easily be accounted for with a few minutes adjusting the EQ at the low end.

Also a feature of note is the DTS surround sound support. It’s a nice-to-have, and atmospheric games are definitely enhanced by its expanded soundstage and precise positioning when listening for something coming up behind you or off in the distance to one side, but for non-first-person games, you’ll want to turn it off.

## Software and Conclusion

The configuration software is neither excellent nor terrible. Like most software of its kind (especially in the Windows world) it simply *is*. One nice feature is the ability to set configurations for specific games or applications. For instance in the case of a top-down isometric game like Heroes of the Storm, you can set the software to automatically switch off DTS surround and turn on microphone monitoring. Generally, updates are frequent and issues are few.

If you’re looking for a wireless headset, there’s little to dislike about the Steelseries Arctis 7s. I’ve enjoyed being untethered from my desk between rounds while still being able to hear the conversations, battery life has been long enough to be a non-issue, and it’s nice to know that my voice sounds more like me whether we’re talking about the latest popular TV series or the next team fight.

You can find the Arctis 7 Headset on [Amazon for around $150](https://amzn.to/2Jlt8w9).
