After two books and quite a bit of procrastination, Barham Ink and <i>Alora's Tear</i>&nbsp;finally have an <a href="http://facebook.com/barhamink">official home on Facebook</a>. As with anything related to my writing, thanks so much for the support.

Every like, every share, every reader counts. Let's see how many we can get! The more people follow this page, the easier it becomes to justify this wonderful second job of mine.

Check back there (or here on BarhamInk.com) for upcoming events, signings, readings, and soon a proper look at Isis Sousa's fantastic art and design for Alora's Tear, Volume III: The Voice like Water.
