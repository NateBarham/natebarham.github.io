The full 42 episode run of the show is still available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://shoutengine.com/CriticallySpeaking/&quot;&gt;ShoutEngine&lt;/a&gt; if for some reason, you’re interested in listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premise has us taking on a piece of videogames journalism each week, looking for meaning and providing commentary on the state of the industry. In addition, we talk about our current obsessions in gaming and generally laugh and have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, each episode has components that are evergreen and some that are very dated. Scott is hilarious and worth a listen just for his spontaneous accents, and the recording production quality is quite high, mostly thanks to our producer/editor Ryan Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the trip down memory lane at your own (quite minimal) risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, the new solution is free. And though I love Squarespace. I think it’s time that I own the content that I’m producing on a broader level. That means designing the site, knowing its ins and outs, and hosting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I’d like the site to be fast (one of the major drawbacks of Squarespace, IMO). The best way to do that is with a static site like the new BarhamInk.com and &lt;a href=&quot;http://natebarham.tumblr.com&quot;&gt;unlike Think Critical&lt;/a&gt; and the old BarhamInk.com which were hosted on Tumblr and Squarespace, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nathan Barham</name></author><summary type="html">Starting a new website is quite the difficult challenge when also working on a new book, but I think that the revamp will be worth the effort in the end.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Writing Process</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/writing/2014/07/18/Writing-Process.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Writing Process" /><published>2014-07-18T09:18:55-07:00</published><updated>2014-07-18T09:18:55-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/writing/2014/07/18/Writing-Process</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/writing/2014/07/18/Writing-Process.html">&lt;p&gt;When I’m not writing books, I spend my days teaching about them. One of my favorite courses each year is Creative Writing (obvious!). Every once in a while a student will ask how I go about my own writing. I’ve collected a few notes here to that effect. Following this list certainly doesn’t guarantee your writing will be good, or even that mine is. These are just some of the patterns I used to get from hundreds words to hundreds of thousands (Yes, &lt;em&gt;Fragments &lt;/em&gt;is technically tens of thousands, 57,000 if you’re looking for any level of accuracy, but it’s not the only book, now is it?). Here they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6380&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;write-daily&quot;&gt;Write Daily&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are few writers who would question this first bit of advice. Whether the analogy is to a muscle that needs exercise to grow stronger or to a practiced skill such as musical scales, one’s word hoard (if you’re Beowulf) needs to be accessed frequently to do it’s best work. It’s easy to tell yourself that words aren’t flowing on a particular day, but the important thing is to put pen to paper (or fingers to keys) anyway. Write even if it’s bad. Write even when a page takes you an hour. Write something different if what you planned isn’t working. Just write. And then, when you’ve written something. Feel free to walk away. Some days are thousand word days and some are ten thousand (and sometimes one hundred). Again. Feel free to walk away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;there-is-no-writers-block&quot;&gt;There is no writer’s block.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6385&quot;&gt;This one might be controversial, but I feel very strongly about it. If you believe that your creative mind, your human ability to express yourself, your capacity for creating beautiful art can be extinguished like a birthday candle flame, then you're right and it will—often. But, if you resist, if you find the secret passage through the wall, the tunnel under the mountain, if you drive your pickaxe into the solid rock face and pull yourself inch by treacherous inch, you'll find that what you once thought was writer's block is now only a distant memory—if you remember it at all. And on the days when you really do have to fight for every word, you will have trained yourself for the fight and not the habitual retreat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6386&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6387&quot;&gt;Don't try to plan everything.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6388&quot;&gt;If I had a nickel for every time Robert Burns's advice proved itself true, well you know. He said, &quot;the best laid plans of mice and men go often askew...&quot; and then followed it up with something darker that John Steinbeck took to a place darker still. But this initial piece carries the point for writing. You may think that your protagonist will fall in love with a certain fetching side character or that the villain will surely be defeated with all of your lovingly crafted friends still intact, but just look to the line above to see where it will get you. Plans are an excellent place to begin, an excellent place to which to return, and a terrible instruction manual with which to tell your story. If your characters are anything like the people we encounter in life, then they'll surprise you, and in so doing will hopefully surprise your audience as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6389&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6390&quot;&gt;Work in the morning.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6391&quot;&gt;This one may be even more controversial than Writer's Block. However, there is no better time in your day to write than when you first come to your senses (notice I didn't say &quot;wake up&quot; because that's a terrible idea). Most importantly this strategy gives you the fewest excuses. You only have to defeat the pull of the snooze button (no easy task, I am aware). Once you have done that—if you've set the alarm early enough, that is—you're free to make something with nothing else on your mind. If you wait until after lunch, the bills or the lawn or the TV show you missed last night will come calling. And, if you wait until the evening? Well, the distractions only grow and your energy only wanes. Attack writing with the freshest energy you can, every time you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6392&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6393&quot;&gt;Edit first thing, then follow the thread.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6394&quot;&gt;To combat the cobwebs that you might be dealing with when following the previous advice, try doing your editing before you write. I find that if I grab a cup of coffee, sit down, and reread my progress from the previous day, I usually find a handful of little changes I can make without slowing myself down too much. This strategy doubles as a way to merge with the stream of your prior work. Often I see clear breaks where writers have picked up the thread cold the following day. We don't use the same language in everyday life as we do when writing (even if your setting is contemporary and your characters are, like, super-trendy!). Give yourself a chance to wake up, a chance to remember, and maybe, just maybe, a chance to enjoy your efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6395&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6396&quot;&gt;Feedback is critical, but in the end it's your story.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6397&quot;&gt;This one is tricky but true. Eventually—if you're serious about this writing thing—you have to ask someone else to read it. When they do, they will have feedback. It might be useful, overly critical, ignorant (in the best way), simple, or just damn right. In whatever way it manifests, you then must deal with it. Sometimes the answer will be to smile, nod, and file it away. If it comes up again, you might have a problem. If it turns up a third time, you most certainly do. Other feedback will make sense immediately, change your story for the better, and just generally make you want to hug the feedbacker (it's like football, right?) like you're the abominable snowman and she (or he) is Bugs Bunny (&quot;I will pat him and pet him and call him George.&quot; Speaking of Steinbeck). Like it says above, in the end you decide what the story is, what happens next, who lives, who dies, who falls in love, and on and on. Just know, that in your decisions you can and will be wrong. Plot twists will fall flat. Scenes will drag. Characters will say too much, or too little. When you make these decisions, do your best to hear what your readers are saying. After all, without them what do you have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6398&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this what we are? Is this what it all comes down to: a man with a hook/ratchet/winch pulling pieces of people’s faces apart? Of course, based on seemingly random patterns, the man might cave in an enemy skull, or simply puncture it with the hook, or fail in the first attempt only to cock back and swing again until the wonderfully rendered human face no longer returns to the frame. Regardless, the result is the same. The player-controlled protagonist bloodily rampages through an intricately designed world crushing, puncturing, and ripping until enemies cease entering his field of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, add wrench, chainsaw, rifle stock, fist, fist with brass knuckles, baseball bat, what have you, and soon enough you’ve got a description that fits a staggering amount of AAA gaming titles released in the last five to ten years. Essentially it’s the formula for the modern shooter: shoot to kill, melee if you can no longer effectively shoot. The closer the enemies get, the gorier the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;written about this before&lt;/a&gt;, about how NPC’s (and enemies especially) can be viewed as little more than digital flies to be swatted in creative ways by the player. And this makes sense in games like Halo, Saints Row, or Dishonored. The player’s goal is to eliminate the enemy (or possibly, incapacitate in the case of Dishonored), to fight through a series of conflicts with a growing array of weapons and skills with which to dispatch the oncoming enemy forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in my recent play-through of Bioshock Infinite, I found myself not only shocked but repulsed by the in-your-face gore and violence—nearly to the degree of shutting the game off entirely. Of course, a laundry list of reasons kept me playing in spite of my initial reaction, but it is the moment of shock that I’ve chosen to discuss here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infinite is a first person shooter. It says so right on the box, or in the game’s Steam description. Why should I then expect anything different from the countless other shooters that flood the industry almost daily? Why was I unfazed by Halo’s Covenant multitudes or the stream of Helghast in Killzone, and yet somehow deeply unsettled by the first Columbia police officer to come into contact with Booker’s sky-hook?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrast and expectation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening sequence of Infinite is similar to its predecessor: a darkened sea, a mysterious lighthouse with various mantras and maxims scattered about. Even the rain and cultish leader echo each other. But whereas the original Bioshock sends the player straight into the demolished underwater world of Rapture, where crazed splicers fling themselves at the player from the very first moments, Infinite takes its time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Booker enters Colombia while its citizens are still at peace. After an eerie baptismal initiation (that arises again cleverly near the game’s conclusion), Booker emerges among the floating platforms of 1800’s Columbia, a city in the sky. Colombia’s people mill about as they prepare for a seemingly exciting annual event: the Raffle. There’s a carnival that gives the player access to Infinite’s various mechanics as a series of carnival games. Booker fires guns at cardboard cutouts of the Vox Populi, who at the time seem to be some sort of rebel gang terrorizing Colombia’s citizens. He tests out tonics, which give him magical abilities and control of the elements. He even sees a late game enemy on display as a carnival attraction. All the while, Columbia’s citizens chat and gossip, ask him questions and ignore him, eat cotton candy and peanuts, play with their children. It’s all very idyllic, with the clear undercurrent signaling some sort of coming upheaval, around which Booker’s story (and the player’s) will most certainly orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing too out-of-the-ordinary so far. We’ve got an intro, a tutorial section, and the makings of an inciting incident. It’s Gaming Plot Mechanics 101. However, unlike the first Bioshock, which introduces the player to combat through trial by fire (electrical shock, actually), Infinite continues with it’s raffle chatter and city gossip as Booker learns about vending machines, Colombia’s currency, health boosts and salts (mana) replenishers, about turret possession, and the mysterious energy that powers the city’s clockwork horse carriages. It’s all very immersive, richly detailed, and for me, downright fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all dreams end with the sleeper awakened. Colombia’s, Booker’s, and the player’s end when the tutorials and lore are exhausted, and the game’s (sometimes a little too obvious) god rays come shining down through the foliage around the Raffle stage. A crowd has gathered in anticipation, and Booker is just in time. He unsurprisingly wins the Raffle, and is presented with a choice: throw a baseball at the interracial couple who have appeared on stage (the crowd’s expected raffle reward) or to throw the ball at the announcer (the player’s rebellious option that implicitly aligns with the cultural norms of the game’s audience).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the choice, Booker is instantly recognized as the False Shepard of Colombia’s prophecies and the audience turns on a dime against him. Here’s where the face-ripping comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem, or brilliance depending on how you assess it, is that up to this point, the people of Colombia have seemed pleasant, polite, and good (if a bit snooty). Now, they’re clearly racist, which on its own is horrible. But does their racism merit tearing through them like so many gazelles in the lion’s jaws? Though, even that comparison would have a purpose, at least the lion eats the gazelles (not that Booker should resort to cannibalism).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may occur to some that the racists have now become enemies and thus fit under my “flies to the swatter” doctrine. Not so. In my previous examples, the Covenant are not peaceful, polite, irritatingly aristocratic ladies and gentlemen. They’re bloodthirsty, though sometimes comical, alien invaders. Ditto for the Helghast, who have their own weak attempts at humanization. Something about Colombia’s denizens is different. Something about Infinite is different. What is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrast. In most games, the desire to get immediately into the action drives the player into a frenzy of shoot, reload, shoot, reload, rest before having a chance to do much of anything else. Even a game like Mass Effect has clear interaction segments and clear combat segments. In Infinite, a peaceful crowd becomes a gruesomely slaughtered string of corpses in seconds. It happens fast, and it happens to NPC’s that before the attack are humanized from the very first moment. Never are even the guards seen as threatening or aggressive until Booker decides to throw the ball. Any more human and Ken Levine and his team might have convinced me to not even play their game at all. How’s that for “Would you kindly?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though contrast does a great deal of the work in setting up the strikingly violent moments after the Raffle, in my case, expectation did the rest. Quite a long time has passed, and a good many titles, since Bioshock (or even the forgettable Bioshock 2). Those games are both well-steeped in gore. Rapture, where the first two games are set, however, is already a bloody mess when the player character arrives. Compound those two details and the expectation is that the protagonist will be adding to the violence that preceded him. Colombia, on the other hand, is clean; we’re talking Disney clean. Everything glows or shines, the clothes are indicative of upper class and the trappings of financial excess. Not only that, but the opening includes no true combat tutorials (just the seemingly innocuous carnival games). Add that to the distance between titles, and a chance to forget just how gory the Bioshock games are, and you have the makings for a stomach churning moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bioshock’s Atlas reveal and the ensuing gameplay segment are powerful but ring of the M. Night Shyamalan school of pulling the rug out from under the audience. Infinite achieves something equally as interesting, if not more so. Under the right circumstances the game evokes an emotional and visceral (as in, gut-wrenching) response early enough that the player might reject the experience all together. And if not that, the observant player is forced to come to grips with Booker’s extremely aggressive tendency toward violence.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nathan Barham</name></author><summary type="html">Minor Spoilers for Bioshock Infinite’s opening section</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Ties that Band</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/education,/music/2013/03/24/The-Ties-that-Band.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Ties that Band" /><published>2013-03-24T09:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2013-03-24T09:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/education,/music/2013/03/24/The-Ties-that-Band</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/education,/music/2013/03/24/The-Ties-that-Band.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in &lt;a href=&quot;http://the-magazine.org&quot;&gt;The Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, Issue 8.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in November, I decided to try my luck with a pitch to The Magazine. I had an idea I thought would work well, and the experience to write the story. Glenn and Marco liked the idea. Here is the full article as it appeared in &lt;a href=&quot;http://the-magazine.org/8/the-ties-that-band&quot;&gt;Issue 8&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-ties-that-band&quot;&gt;The Ties That Band&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toby is struggling. In rehearsal after rehearsal, Toby can’t seem to pull it together. He’s not keeping his toes up, not keeping his back straight, not playing the right notes. It seems like a lot to remember, but he will have to achieve it all in order to march in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/user/prideofclarkston&quot;&gt;Pride of Clarkston Marching Band and Color Guard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staff takes turns following him from set to set, helping him count as he tries to play the music from memory; there are no music stands attached to instruments in a competition band. His shoulders slump, his instrument bell dips to one side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toby’s my project. There are always a few. As assistant director of the marching band, I need to help Toby (a composite of many students I’ve worked with) and all 70-some other marchers break through their difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“…17, 18, 19, 20!” I shout, as we near the next transition. In this move, Toby has to change direction from forward to backward. It sounds easy, but the body control required takes immense focus, especially for a 14-year-old high school freshman. Timing must be precise, with the size of each step measured and equal. Any variation can undermine the integrity of the drill design. The smallest error means judges take points off in the marching and maneuvering category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director Bill Legg stops the band, and I catch up with Toby. An iPhone glows in my hand with the drill set’s series of overlapping arcs. I point to Toby’s coordinate. “Did you see that?” I ask. “Twenty-four counts, prep, and go. You got that part right. Next time you have to keep playing. And keep your bell up. And smaller steps, so that you hit your mark.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do the move a few more times. The first is a disaster for Toby; now he’s thinking too hard. Music, step size, counting — it all falls apart. But we rehearse it again and again. The fourth time, it’s much better. His feet lock into position with the authority of a drill sergeant, and I cheer him on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s perfect. You nailed it that time!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toby grins. Yeah, it’s better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;band-ten-hut&quot;&gt;Band, Ten-Hut!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prideofclarkston.com/&quot;&gt;Pride of Clarkston&lt;/a&gt;, an 80-piece marching band from a small-town high school in southeastern Washington, has competed around the state for more than 30 years. Band traditions date back decades — more than a century for marching bands — but two years ago, ours took a decidedly modern turn. I began using my iPhone to manage drill-charts and count sequences. Now, iOS devices are the staff’s primary tools for recording, monitoring, tuning, and teaching the band’s students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the summer, the band retreats to Camp Wooten, a wooded site along the waters of the Tucannon River, where for 33 years the season’s first rehearsals have taken place. During a three-day stint at camp, the band learns how to march (it’s not just walking in time), how to find their coordinates (the precise locations in which they should stand to create legible shapes for the audience), and how to move between those points, all while playing an instrument and focusing their eyes on the stands rather than the ground beneath their feet. Some make an easy start of it, but most will stumble and recover. Nearly all come away with an invigorating sense of accomplishment and teamwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only three years ago, the Pride had a blanket “no cellphone” policy during rehearsals, be it during camp or back home. Screens meant distraction and disconnect from the unity of the group. Today, when the phones come out, they have a different purpose: They’re tools instead of toys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the summer retreat, the army of volunteers affectionately dubbed “the Band Parents” gets involved, too. Pacing up and down formations with iPads, iPods, and iPhones — and possibly some Android devices — parents and staff spend the day capturing clips of the Pride’s performers in action. Later, on the screen set up at the back of the tin-roofed mess hall, student after student marches past. Some are splendid examples and others not so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The band members watch with rapt attention as their digital selves glide over the field. They critique their own posture and execution while applauding newcomers to whom marching seems like second nature. At the next rehearsal, groups of students are on the field early, working to improve what they’ve seen in the video. Again the staff and parents film, and again the students watch, and again the band improves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;forward-glide&quot;&gt;Forward, Glide&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in Clarkston, I squint and angle the phone screen away from my face. It’s bright out, but I can still read the conversation. It’s from the Band Instructors Facebook group, where our preparations for rehearsal often begin. Everyone agrees: We have a &lt;em&gt;march-style&lt;/em&gt; problem to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March-style is the specific set of rules that the band uses to define how each member should traverse the field. For instance, Clarkston uses a rolled-toe forward march and an on-the-toes backward march. When a performer moves across the field, his or her shoulders must stay parallel to the sideline while feet point in the direction of travel — imagine a tank’s turret versus its tracks. Marchers’ posture must be straight-backed, with their weight forward and their instrument elevated so that they appear to be playing into the stadium press box instead of the sideline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All bands have a march-style problem; it’s part of learning the skill. However, this rehearsal has particular challenges. Not only do we have march style to fix, we have music memorization, musicality, choreography, and a lot of cleaning up to make sure that the shapes on the field look like arcs and lines instead of illegible blobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We break the rehearsal into blocks, deciding how much time we should spend on each technique as well as on each section of the show. The schedule goes into our smartphones so that each staff member has quick access to what will be happening next, and so we don’t get mired in any one section or technique. With the schedule finished, it’s out to the field for rehearsal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dress-set-dress&quot;&gt;Dress Set, Dress&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the three months following camp, the band learns an entire show, performs it in front of an audience or a panel of judges (or both), and then takes the critique back to the practice field to make improvements. The band’s staff members rely on phones and tablets and laptops to support almost every adjustment we make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the season, the band visits Auburn, Washington, for its final competition. After the daylong bus ride, the students scurry out at the Westfield Southcenter in Tukwila. From a seat in a newly opened burrito eatery, the staff adds one last iOS touch to an already heavy touchscreen season: a scavenger hunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a group-texting app, students exchange messages with the staff. First to take a photo of an item costing more than $100? A shot from the neighboring Guitar Center comes back. Okay, then. First photo of an item over $5000? A picture appears from the Smart car display in front of the food court. How about video of the most students doing the ballad choreography? Three videos pop out, one with the students in flying V formation and a conductor leading them. They lean and sway, slide and bow, click their heels, and sing the music as confused shoppers pass by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all in fun and brings the students together even when they are spread out across hundreds of thousands of square feet. The scavenger hunt  is what they’ll remember, but the staff knows the real reason for the texts: Every student must be with a group that has a smartphone. Almost all of them have one; those who don’t pair up with those who do. When it comes time to gather the scattered students, a text goes out. Everyone gets to the bus, and no one has to stand around waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope to find even more ways to use the technology, from sound mixing to rehearsal tracks to synthetic sounds. The Band Parents want to buy a high-quality audio system to bring Clarkston further into the modern era of marching band. Many schools already use electronic instruments in their pit percussion sections, and one or two of the Pride’s higher-division competitors even mix and sample sounds using iPads. When the new system arrives, there will be an iPad at the ready in Clarkston.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;band-dismissed&quot;&gt;Band, Dismissed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing their final competition performance of the year, the Pride exits the field with smiles on their faces and light in their eyes. One of the smiles is Toby’s. His step size was perfect, with his toes rolling on forward march and his heels high in backward march. He and the rest of the band have just performed the best version of the show to date, and they can feel it. The crowd can feel it, too. For the second time in three years, the Pride wins the Spirit of Auburn People’s Choice Award at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://auburnveteransday.webs.com&quot;&gt;Veterans Day Marching Band Championships&lt;/a&gt;. On the way to the photography area, students high-five and embrace in teary-eyed hugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they climb the bleachers, one voice rises from the group, singing a steady, muffled note. Another adds to the sound, and then another. Soon, the whole band is singing a major chord. One senior, the band’s drum major, sings the original note two octaves higher in a lilting falsetto. When the photographer cuts them off, the band grins back for the camera. Singing isn’t usually scored in marching band, but togetherness is. Smartphones still aren’t allowed in performance uniforms, and so the moment remains in memories alone. Some things were meant to stay analog.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nathan Barham</name></author><summary type="html">This article first appeared in The Magazine, Issue 8.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mass Effect’s Ending</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/gaming/2012/09/09/Mass-Effect's-Ending.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mass Effect's Ending" /><published>2012-09-09T03:57:00-07:00</published><updated>2012-09-09T03:57:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/gaming/2012/09/09/Mass-Effect's-Ending</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/gaming/2012/09/09/Mass-Effect's-Ending.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to understand Mass Effect’s conclusion, you have to start not at the beginning, but at the end, the very end. After the credits roll, an old man—and a child who appears to be his grandson—stand in a grove of trees looking out onto a spectacular night sky. The child listens in wonder as the grandfather finishes Mass Effect’s narrative, then asks if the grandfather will tell him another story about “the Shepherd.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In creating a series that spans hundreds of choices, a spectrum of &lt;em&gt;morality&lt;/em&gt; decisions, battles in which any number of characters can die, and various overall design adjustments, Mass Effect manages to finish with a coherent epilogue that encompasses all possible narrative conclusions. Beyond the color-coded final choice offered to Commander Shepard at the pinnacle of the transformed citadel-plus-crucible device, whether you played before or after the expanded ending, the Mass Effect universe ends the same: life goes on, and Commander Shepard was the key piece in deciding how that life would continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the grandfather epilogue provides a meaningful connection back to the single most-repeated word over the course of dozens of hours of gameplay: Shepard. Think about all the times you heard that name. Remember the YouTube videos that compiled characters saying it again and again. And whether it’s superficial or not, the connection to the epilogue’s Shepherd—the protector—cannot be taken for granted. &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; Commander Shepard would become was decided before the player even presses start at the first game’s opening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;But it takes away player agency at the last moment!&lt;/em&gt;” you cry. Perhaps it does, but weren’t you paying attention as all those hours of dialogue, cutscenes, and Codex entries rolled by? Races in the Mass Effect universe have only the illusion of choice. Everything goes back to the inevitable cycle which ends with the coming of the Reapers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;But I chose to wipe out all synthetics!&lt;/em&gt;” you say. That’s all well and good for you, but according to the narrative content (which you only ignore if you’re under the delusion that you are making the story, not experiencing a story authored by someone else) synthetic life will again reemerge when a technologically advanced race &lt;em&gt;invents it&lt;/em&gt;. So there it is, cyclical thinking, just as the game narrative has presented from day one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there other ways the designers could have concluded the trilogy, yes. Could the voice acting have been better in the epilogue, certainly. But it is the epilogue that finishes Mass Effect, not the choice of Commander Shepard (or the player). The series, it seems, strives to make two points concerning the end of its narrative. The first is that even in a veritable universe’s worth of decisions, all choices lead to the same eventual end. The second is that choice defines character, and character is more important than events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the grandfather tells the story to his grandson, when the events of Mass Effect have become tales from long ago, it is not &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; happened in the story that matters but &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nathan Barham</name></author><summary type="html">Spoilers</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Murderfest of the Flies</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/gaming,/politics/2012/04/29/Murderfest-of-the-Flies.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Murderfest of the Flies" /><published>2012-04-29T04:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2012-04-29T04:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/gaming,/politics/2012/04/29/Murderfest-of%20the-Flies</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/gaming,/politics/2012/04/29/Murderfest-of-the-Flies.html">&lt;p&gt;In the extensive &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/the-most-dangerous-gamer/8928/&quot;&gt;piece on Jonathan Blow&lt;/a&gt; for The Atlantic, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/taylor-clark/&quot;&gt;Taylor Clark&lt;/a&gt; explores more than any one commentary could possibly cover. If you want to get lost in scathing critique of the mainstream gaming industry for several thousand words, I encourage you to read it. Also, &lt;em&gt;Braid&lt;/em&gt; spoilers abound, so proceed with caution if you haven’t played and/or finished it yet (I haven’t).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What stood out from Clark’s article for me came early and stands a bit outside its thesis. In a rant on the current crop of AAA games, Clark calls them “cartoonish murderfests.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was 18 and just out of high school, I spent the summer working in a place I remember only as, the shack. The details of my job are now irrelevant, but the place itself could not be more apt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, the shack had one overwhelming, disgusting, and inescapable constant: flies. Not just a few irritating flies, not even what most would say amounts to “a lot” of flies. No, in and around the shack, thousands of buzzing, swarming, excretion-devouring, filth-pests gathered each and every day. Yeah. It was bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what were three guys stranded in said shack supposed to do about it? Kill them. And kill we did. Like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Valiant_Little_Tailor&quot;&gt;brave little tailor&lt;/a&gt; in the old story, we often felled “five-in-one-blow” if not the protagonist’s full seven-at-a-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does this pertain to gaming? I think many readers might have already guessed (like &lt;em&gt;The Return of the King&lt;/em&gt;, my title may reveal too much). The flies are the murderfest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who looks down on a person for swatting so many flies? Very few would morally object to the elimination of such pests. Likening the kill count in &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Skyrim&lt;/em&gt;, or any other in the obviously large number of games in which eliminating targets is the primary objective to murder is sensational at best and possibly outright dishonest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In actuality, there is very little difference between “shooting” Space Invaders and “shooting” CoD’s fictional terrorists. They are, in fact, so many dots moving on a screen. Flies are actual living creatures, albeit gross ones. Dots aren’t. When the player pulls the trigger on fictional terrorist #2,568, the said collection of pixels has even less ethical merit than fly #2,568 in the shack. So, murderfest might be a bit hyperbolic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright then, when is digital death equivalent to such a horrible act? I might say never, but to call every video game death the same as swatting flies is shortsighted and reductive. When the player chooses to end the digital existence of a character with meaningful backstory and emotional connection, it comes closer to Clark’s critique. For instance when Desmond Miles (and the player thereby) is forced to kill their strongest advocate and emotional attachment over the course of three games, an invested player should feel a sense of guilt. Even so, this is not the same—thankfully—as the real-world act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is thus that murder is incredibly unlikely (even using any foreseeable technological advance) to be simulated to the level at which the digital and the real become equals (again, for emphasis and even in italics, &lt;em&gt;thankfully&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clark’s words are an irresponsible over-exaggeration made to cast Jonathan Blow’s distance from the mainstream in a positive light. And while that may be a worthy cause, the choice of words is misguided and harmful to the medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider my hat tipped to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.critical-distance.com/2012/04/29/april-29th/&quot;&gt;Critical Distance&lt;/a&gt; for leading me down this rabbit hole.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nathan Barham</name></author><summary type="html">In the extensive piece on Jonathan Blow for The Atlantic, Taylor Clark explores more than any one commentary could possibly cover.
