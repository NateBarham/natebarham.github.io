The full 42 episode run of the show is still available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://shoutengine.com/CriticallySpeaking/&quot;&gt;ShoutEngine&lt;/a&gt; if for some reason, you’re interested in listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premise has us taking on a piece of videogames journalism each week, looking for meaning and providing commentary on the state of the industry. In addition, we talk about our current obsessions in gaming and generally laugh and have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, each episode has components that are evergreen and some that are very dated. Scott is hilarious and worth a listen just for his spontaneous accents, and the recording production quality is quite high, mostly thanks to our producer/editor Ryan Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the trip down memory lane at your own (quite minimal) risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, the new solution is free. And though I love Squarespace. I think it’s time that I own the content that I’m producing on a broader level. That means designing the site, knowing its ins and outs, and hosting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I’d like the site to be fast (one of the major drawbacks of Squarespace, IMO). The best way to do that is with a static site like the new BarhamInk.com and &lt;a href=&quot;http://natebarham.tumblr.com&quot;&gt;unlike Think Critical&lt;/a&gt; and the old BarhamInk.com which were hosted on Tumblr and Squarespace, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nathan Barham</name></author><summary type="html">Starting a new website is quite the difficult challenge when also working on a new book, but I think that the revamp will be worth the effort in the end.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Equilibrium</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/apple/2016/07/17/Equilibrium.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Equilibrium" /><published>2016-07-17T09:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-17T09:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/apple/2016/07/17/Equilibrium</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/apple/2016/07/17/Equilibrium.html">&lt;p&gt;It’s 1997 and I’ve just researched and configured the best PC I can imagine for what was then a reasonable price. The beast, an ominous black tower in a world of boring beige, has a CPU ten times faster than the Packard Bell it’s replacing. It runs a new technology called AGP, which the sales person assures me is not only as good as the popular PCI solution but better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short, that guy was either a liar or an idiot. The lie plagued my perception of that PC from the very start and fueled an imbalance that may only now be coming to rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, from that point forward there was always something incredible right around the corner. At first, it was a new PC that would be powerful enough to run the games I wanted to play at the time (AGP wasn’t upgradable, and the built-in card was starved for video memory, a critically important spec back then).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was a laptop that felt like a real computer and not a hamstrung hack attempting the future before its time. I used some laptops (IBM, Compaq, HP) but didn’t pursue buying. I found that dream laptop (excuse me, notebook) in a Titanium PowerBook G4, ever after referred to affectionately as the TiBook. It had a trackpad that worked as advertised, a widescreen display, an operating system that looked modern, even futuristic without looking like a neon sign in Vegas, and that beautifully designed case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battery life was good for the time, but not great in practical use. It was powerful, but buying or building a desktop with visibly more power was still easy and relatively cheap. And so the balance favored the future again, and I waited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to my notebook-that-feels-like-a-desktop came with a Penryn Macbook Pro. It even played PC games of the time at respectable frame rates using Boot Camp. That machine, to this day is probably my favorite computer. I wrote my first novel on it, played countless hours of World of Warcraft, edited the first videos of my daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the imbalance came again. Despite its power, mobility grew more important. Lighter, thinner, better battery life, the list that lay just around the corner. A Macbook Air came next, and now a Macbook, tiny and light, powerful enough to do all that I want these days on my work computer, and the most beautifully designed notebook I’ve ever seen (good luck topping this one, Jonny).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’d traded performance for portability, so I built a gaming PC between the time of the stalwart Macbook Pro and the Macbook Air: my for-fun computer. It is fast and powerful, even today, and with a reasonable upgrade to the GPU, runs current games at another of those ever-retreating corners I’ve been waiting so long to turn, 1080p 60fps. Consoles haven’t truly done it yet, and look to be making the jump to 4k before they get the chance. As for me, I look at the 4k televisions in stores and see very little real world difference between them and my 1080p plasma, unlike with Retina where the difference achieved another past-fantasy tech milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that gets us to my point. I’ve reached a point of equilibrium in tech. Light, powerful, beautiful notebook, check (then do the same for TV display, set-top box, sound system, gaming PC, tablet, phone, even a smartwatch). With all of this amazing hardware, and the always evolving (usually improving) software, there are so few real world corners left to turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s always a new iPhone on the horizon, of course, a new everything. For the first time, however, none of it feels particularly pressing. Nothing feels like “Oh, if I only had a machine that would…” at this point. The last two items on my list were 1080p 60fps and an instantly responding Apple Watch (which, though I don’t have it yet, seems to be the real deal with WatchOS 3). It’s a somewhat peaceful and somewhat empty feeling, as if a part of me dissolved without my permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out there, some will shout “VR!” and “Self-driving cars!” and whatever else. I’ve tried VR, and it’s an interesting curiosity. I’m intrigued by a self-driving car, but the corner to turn for that one seems years away, maybe a decade, and that’s not considering the fact that a teacher’s salary is extremely unlikely to pay for one in the first — or second — phase (even the 30k Tesla Model 3 is priced beyond that, and that’s with virtually no autonomous features, or at least not the impressive, world changing ones).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for now, and possibly the first time since I was 13 or 14, the world of technology seems good enough. Can it get better? Always, and I fully expect it to. Will I want some new shiny thing come September, probably, but if Apple released nothing, just went totally dark, I’d be fine, and not in the sense that I’d survive, but in the sense that I wouldn’t feel compelled to ask for anything more. This 6S performs brilliantly in every measure I can think of. Ditto for all my other current devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the most difficult part of balance is maintaining it. Perhaps that’s the new question. Is that next reveal enough to tip the scales? Is there something out there that’s coming up next that completes an imagined technological picture you have for yourself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, for now — for once — the answer is “No.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nathan Barham</name></author><summary type="html">It’s 1997 and I’ve just researched and configured the best PC I can imagine for what was then a reasonable price.

I am not your ally, nor are you mine. You are a scourge that needs silencing and a pestilence in need of a cure. Stop this nonsense immediately and stand with the rest of us — for something — not against something in a thinly veiled attempt to justify your hate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following thoughts arose from a number of conservative family members asking why I support Bernie Sanders. For some time I’ve wanted to write a post encapsulating my decision and continued position. This is my response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a clear-thinking, educated person, I understand where the money for a progressive agenda would have to come from. I understand that I would pay more to the system in hopes of saving money elsewhere and to help those who need it most. These values are not foolish, ill conceived, or even unrealistic. I am not some hoodwinked, moony-eyed youth, dazzled by the allure of free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not make these decisions lightly but with the most concerted of efforts to fully understand my own position foremost, and those of others so as to not be blind to the faults of my own choice (and there are several) or the virtues of others’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, a few principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our government should help those who need help, and all people should have a truly equal chance. The US healthcare system is a blight that needs to be eradicated, replaced with an alternative reflecting the modern world and not a profit machine fueled by illness and misfortune. I respect those who fight for a noble cause, even when it is not popular. Only the people should be able to affect elections, not large corporate donations and backdoor deals. Our voting system — the key component to the greatness of our country — is broken, designed to punish the powerless and reward the powerful when it should simply count each person and their singular vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not support dividing everyone’s income to the point at which we are all paid the same. That scenario would be communist. Some have earned an easier life by sacrifice, and some have earned a harder one. If socialism means balancing the scales so that the American dream — that pursuit of a better life through hard work can result in success for any person willing to do said work — can be real again, then I am indeed for socialism. But I have always (even when I voted for Bush in 2000) insisted that our government exists to work for us, and that we pay into it for the services it can provide, be it roads and bridges, education, a military to protect us (though only as a last resort), or with clean, efficient energy, and a healthcare system that helps everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched as a corrupt insurance industry and profit-driven medical industry depleted my Grandparents’ savings while my Grandfather struggled with the horror of dementia and my Grandmother struggled as her partner of five decades fought against that horror. And it only got worse as his condition got worse. It turns my stomach to think of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I look into my son’s bleeding face (he fell and bumped his chin on the bed) I am ashamed that even one of my first thoughts is given to the bill and not to his pain or fear. Every thought should go to him. This too turns my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we generate all of this prosperity if we must live in fear that it will be swept away by random chance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some events are unavoidable. But if our government is going to pay for something with the taxes they extract from us, let it be this. And the most embarrassing part for our nation is that other countries have already solved this problem. The systems vary, and none are perfect, but they are all more effective and far less expensive than ours. This is the issue for which I feel the most passionate, partial measures will not do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In high school I read Wayne Gretzky’s biography, and one quote stood out (a quote I also appreciated much later when Steve Jobs reiterated it). He said, “I skate to where the puck is going, not to where it has been.” I began then to apply this philosophy to my political views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a hundred years, a thousand, will the greatest country on Earth help its people when they are sick, or will it watch them suffer as their life savings is instantly consumed and they worry about money when they should be focusing on those for whom they care most? After examining all of my politics under this lens, I saw what I would someday want in a politician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, about a years ago, I read about Bernie Sanders. Nearly all of his policies pass my self-imposed test. In a hundred, a thousand years will we: restrict people based on their gender, race, or sexual orientation? Listen to them instead of saying that the problem is already solved? Power our industry and personal lives cleanly and efficiently or in whatever way is most profitable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will we be at war with a world full of enemies, or will we have found solutions to render those enemies ineffectual and irrelevant — or even have managed to make them into allies? Will we pride ourselves in the education of our people — so much so that we would pay to make certain that they are all educated? Will we, the people, decide what steps our government takes, making sure that it acts in our interests and not in the interests of others?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, will we still remain at the whims of capitalist industry, which though it has served us well, has clear flaws that concentrate wealth and power at the top, while continuously forcing those at the bottom further and further down? Will we shout insults, build walls, and shoot first, asking questions later like fearful cavemen (or women) cowering in the dark, paranoid of everyone and everything that is not like us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, will we apathetically accept that the world cannot be changed, that our lives, and the lives of those whose are the hardest, cannot be improved? Will we reach for half-loves and smile when given our quarter portion? Will we deal and barter with swindlers who already have more than they and a dozen generations of their descendants could ever use?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many of our major victories as a people came from skating to where the puck was going, to where the world was going. The pilgrims who crossed the Atlantic did. The revolutionaries did. Lincoln did with the emancipation. When we awoke to Hitler and the Japanese, when women won the right to vote, when the Civil Rights Act was passed, when Neil Armstrong landed on the moon, we skated to where the world was going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we know this only in hindsight. Now, today, we must choose to the best of our abilities where we think the puck will go. Bernie Sanders aims for where I think the puck will be. I support him because I want all of us to be there, too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nathan Barham</name></author><summary type="html">Before I begin: If you support Bernie by harassing women or other public figures, attacking Hillary Clinton with sexist language and the tactics of the vile Gamergate or other foul misogynist hate groups, I am not your friend.

Do you still enjoy wearing an Apple Watch every day? Maybe you like the look of Tesla’s upcoming Model 3 or use your iPad Pro as a full-fledged computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop me if you’ve heard this one before, but you’re wrong. Wrong for liking things that others don’t, wrong for attempting to understand where these designs and products are coming from rather than critiquing the obvious compromises they’ve made or the places where they’ve actually chosen to diverge from the herd, wrong, wrong, wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe wrong, as long as the future plays out a certain way and those spouting constant criticism turn out to be right (even a broken clock…). And what is right? Is it vindication in finding a MacBook five years from now that’s much faster and has much better battery life? If so, the great online advisors can claim the win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“See, we told you v1 was underpowered and had terrible battery.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, “See, we told you that Tesla would have to change that no-grille design if they wanted to sell more cars.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem is, they have merely predicted the inevitable. Computers will get faster, cars will have different visual touches, tablet operating systems will become more capable. Meanwhile, many must sit back and watch as the collective club nods sagely at each other for fear of ending up being the one who was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For being the one who liked Apple Watch 1.0, they will suffer the future torment of “I told you so.” And then won’t they feel dumb? After all, isn’t the most important thing to appear smart? Turns out (TM), you can be smart and disagree with the crowd. You can be insightful, and not correctly predict the future. And more essentially, simply by offering a different viewpoint, you can create a much more interesting discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I encouraging vehement Mac vs. PC era arguments? No. Am I saying that the conventional wisdom of a few high profile voices is always wrong? No. But the discourse suffers from the fear of being in the out group, the fear of having a dissenting opinion. If we were all wrong a little more often, we’d have a much more varied conversation and foster inclusivity at a basic level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’ll say it. I think all of these products are great, intriguing, and worthy of discussion from many viewpoints, not just criticisms of their most obvious compromises. And none of them are perfect. None are above criticism, but they are above only criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think the same, you should not be afraid to say so, because understanding why something is the way it is informs us of the reality in which we live and not a fantasy where we get to design a world we would prefer. After all, we don’t study the horse only to say that it is not a unicorn, and that if evolution (or deity) had only included a three-foot horn on the horse’s forehead, it would have been an acceptable creature. Instead we understand the beauty of the thing as it is, what evolutionary steps may have led to its current form, and maybe every so often wonder if the unicorn is out there somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unicorn becomes part of the larger understanding, just as our wished-for versions of iOS or a Mac Pro with gaming GPUs should be a part. Speculate, certainly. Criticize, of course. But don’t forget that the larger part of the fun is to analyze and thus further understand the things we are interested in. Stop caving to the social pressure of being right. Be reasonable, be considerate, but worry more about appreciating the thing before leveling the same criticism that a half-dozen full-time pundits have already articulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s ok. Appreciation is not equivalent to inferior intellect.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nathan Barham</name></author><summary type="html">Do you like Apple’s Retina MacBook?

And although the idea began with the Macintosh, the device closest to this particular Jobs ideal didn’t arrive in earnest until the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPhone is the computer for everyone, the one we can all use without an instruction manual and without extensive training. We use it in line at the DMV and as we wait for the water to boil; we use it at the breakfast table and (though it might be a bit crass) on the toilet. It is a part of us, it is us. We work and we play on it, ask it questions when we don’t know the answers, even send photos and communications we’d be embarrassed by were they ever let into the light of day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t let you know what I say to my wife in the privacy of our bedroom, though if you had a warrant and a surveillance team, I suppose you could listen. But even more than that — more than that — I’d never let you read my mind, let you know what I don’t even choose to tell her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve was right. This little computer is a bicycle for the mind, but not in that it lets me do things faster and more efficiently (it does that, too). It’s an extension of the mind, a part of it, an inextricably intertwined augmentation of our thoughts. The iPhone (and the smartphone in general) lets me store more thoughts, remember moments more often and more vividly, and it is able to do so because I trust it. I trust that my musings and photos and videos are safe there. And more and more as time goes on, this has become true.
It’s not a fetishization, Mr. President, it’s a fact. The contents of my phone, and other devices where I store things that I have yet to elect to share with the world — and may, in fact, never share — are private.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These unshared thoughts, imaginings, creations are just that: unshared.
They are private.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no. Not you, not your three letter organizations, not anyone has a right to see them if I’ve decided that they are so. Take them by force if you can, legislate if you must (and you should), but don’t leverage the locksmith as if it’s his responsibility to let you in. He doesn’t have a right to it either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This device is a digital extension of my mind, a container for my thoughts, a memory of more precise capacity and greater longevity, a secret part of who I am, that I may open to you if I so choose. There is a key, but like the one for my biological mind, I and only I am the single person who may use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one — not even the President of the United States — has a right to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you read my mind if you had the chance? Is that where this ends? I thought that we had the right to remain silent, to withhold that which would incriminate us. Do we have that right? Or will it dissolve as soon as it becomes technically feasible to circumvent it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The particular phone you want to access today may not have been an extension of its user’s mind. But the key that will unlock it would unlock mine and my wife’s and someday my children’s. It would open a door for actors from less benevolent governments, if only enough to slip in the steel toe of a combat boot. And as we know, once a crack has opened, any number of plague ridden vermin will find it. It is a matter of time, an outcome so certain that decades of research and billions of dollars have only just been able to stave it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, though I have the right to remain silent, I choose to say this: many have claimed that this case is not about one phone (the government seems to see it otherwise). I will contradict them, arguing that it is about precisely this one phone because one is all. By opening one, you’ve opened them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By weakening one, you weaken us all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nathan Barham</name></author><summary type="html">Steve Jobs famously called the computer a “bicycle for the mind,” an extension of ourselves that would not only make life easier, but improve it.

&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6380&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;write-daily&quot;&gt;Write Daily&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are few writers who would question this first bit of advice. Whether the analogy is to a muscle that needs exercise to grow stronger or to a practiced skill such as musical scales, one’s word hoard (if you’re Beowulf) needs to be accessed frequently to do it’s best work. It’s easy to tell yourself that words aren’t flowing on a particular day, but the important thing is to put pen to paper (or fingers to keys) anyway. Write even if it’s bad. Write even when a page takes you an hour. Write something different if what you planned isn’t working. Just write. And then, when you’ve written something. Feel free to walk away. Some days are thousand word days and some are ten thousand (and sometimes one hundred). Again. Feel free to walk away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;there-is-no-writers-block&quot;&gt;There is no writer’s block.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6385&quot;&gt;This one might be controversial, but I feel very strongly about it. If you believe that your creative mind, your human ability to express yourself, your capacity for creating beautiful art can be extinguished like a birthday candle flame, then you're right and it will—often. But, if you resist, if you find the secret passage through the wall, the tunnel under the mountain, if you drive your pickaxe into the solid rock face and pull yourself inch by treacherous inch, you'll find that what you once thought was writer's block is now only a distant memory—if you remember it at all. And on the days when you really do have to fight for every word, you will have trained yourself for the fight and not the habitual retreat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6386&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6387&quot;&gt;Don't try to plan everything.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6388&quot;&gt;If I had a nickel for every time Robert Burns's advice proved itself true, well you know. He said, &quot;the best laid plans of mice and men go often askew...&quot; and then followed it up with something darker that John Steinbeck took to a place darker still. But this initial piece carries the point for writing. You may think that your protagonist will fall in love with a certain fetching side character or that the villain will surely be defeated with all of your lovingly crafted friends still intact, but just look to the line above to see where it will get you. Plans are an excellent place to begin, an excellent place to which to return, and a terrible instruction manual with which to tell your story. If your characters are anything like the people we encounter in life, then they'll surprise you, and in so doing will hopefully surprise your audience as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6389&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6390&quot;&gt;Work in the morning.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6391&quot;&gt;This one may be even more controversial than Writer's Block. However, there is no better time in your day to write than when you first come to your senses (notice I didn't say &quot;wake up&quot; because that's a terrible idea). Most importantly this strategy gives you the fewest excuses. You only have to defeat the pull of the snooze button (no easy task, I am aware). Once you have done that—if you've set the alarm early enough, that is—you're free to make something with nothing else on your mind. If you wait until after lunch, the bills or the lawn or the TV show you missed last night will come calling. And, if you wait until the evening? Well, the distractions only grow and your energy only wanes. Attack writing with the freshest energy you can, every time you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6392&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6393&quot;&gt;Edit first thing, then follow the thread.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6394&quot;&gt;To combat the cobwebs that you might be dealing with when following the previous advice, try doing your editing before you write. I find that if I grab a cup of coffee, sit down, and reread my progress from the previous day, I usually find a handful of little changes I can make without slowing myself down too much. This strategy doubles as a way to merge with the stream of your prior work. Often I see clear breaks where writers have picked up the thread cold the following day. We don't use the same language in everyday life as we do when writing (even if your setting is contemporary and your characters are, like, super-trendy!). Give yourself a chance to wake up, a chance to remember, and maybe, just maybe, a chance to enjoy your efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6395&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6396&quot;&gt;Feedback is critical, but in the end it's your story.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6397&quot;&gt;This one is tricky but true. Eventually—if you're serious about this writing thing—you have to ask someone else to read it. When they do, they will have feedback. It might be useful, overly critical, ignorant (in the best way), simple, or just damn right. In whatever way it manifests, you then must deal with it. Sometimes the answer will be to smile, nod, and file it away. If it comes up again, you might have a problem. If it turns up a third time, you most certainly do. Other feedback will make sense immediately, change your story for the better, and just generally make you want to hug the feedbacker (it's like football, right?) like you're the abominable snowman and she (or he) is Bugs Bunny (&quot;I will pat him and pet him and call him George.&quot; Speaking of Steinbeck). Like it says above, in the end you decide what the story is, what happens next, who lives, who dies, who falls in love, and on and on. Just know, that in your decisions you can and will be wrong. Plot twists will fall flat. Scenes will drag. Characters will say too much, or too little. When you make these decisions, do your best to hear what your readers are saying. After all, without them what do you have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1405700307931_6398&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

One of my favorite courses each year is Creative Writing (obvious!). Every once in a while a student will ask how I go about my own writing. I’ve collected a few notes here to that effect. Following this list certainly doesn’t guarantee your writing will be good, or even that mine is. These are just some of the patterns I used to get from hundreds words to hundreds of thousands (Yes, Fragments is technically tens of thousands, 57,000 if you’re looking for any level of accuracy, but it’s not the only book, now is it?). Here they are.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Violence and Bioshock Infinite</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/gaming,/politics/2013/08/15/Violence-and-Bioshock-Infinite.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Violence and Bioshock Infinite" /><published>2013-08-15T09:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2013-08-15T09:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/gaming,/politics/2013/08/15/Violence-and-Bioshock-Infinite</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/gaming,/politics/2013/08/15/Violence-and-Bioshock-Infinite.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minor Spoilers for Bioshock Infinite’s opening section&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this what we are? Is this what it all comes down to: a man with a hook/ratchet/winch pulling pieces of people’s faces apart? Of course, based on seemingly random patterns, the man might cave in an enemy skull, or simply puncture it with the hook, or fail in the first attempt only to cock back and swing again until the wonderfully rendered human face no longer returns to the frame. Regardless, the result is the same. The player-controlled protagonist bloodily rampages through an intricately designed world crushing, puncturing, and ripping until enemies cease entering his field of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, add wrench, chainsaw, rifle stock, fist, fist with brass knuckles, baseball bat, what have you, and soon enough you’ve got a description that fits a staggering amount of AAA gaming titles released in the last five to ten years. Essentially it’s the formula for the modern shooter: shoot to kill, melee if you can no longer effectively shoot. The closer the enemies get, the gorier the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;written about this before&lt;/a&gt;, about how NPC’s (and enemies especially) can be viewed as little more than digital flies to be swatted in creative ways by the player. And this makes sense in games like Halo, Saints Row, or Dishonored. The player’s goal is to eliminate the enemy (or possibly, incapacitate in the case of Dishonored), to fight through a series of conflicts with a growing array of weapons and skills with which to dispatch the oncoming enemy forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in my recent play-through of Bioshock Infinite, I found myself not only shocked but repulsed by the in-your-face gore and violence—nearly to the degree of shutting the game off entirely. Of course, a laundry list of reasons kept me playing in spite of my initial reaction, but it is the moment of shock that I’ve chosen to discuss here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infinite is a first person shooter. It says so right on the box, or in the game’s Steam description. Why should I then expect anything different from the countless other shooters that flood the industry almost daily? Why was I unfazed by Halo’s Covenant multitudes or the stream of Helghast in Killzone, and yet somehow deeply unsettled by the first Columbia police officer to come into contact with Booker’s sky-hook?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrast and expectation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening sequence of Infinite is similar to its predecessor: a darkened sea, a mysterious lighthouse with various mantras and maxims scattered about. Even the rain and cultish leader echo each other. But whereas the original Bioshock sends the player straight into the demolished underwater world of Rapture, where crazed splicers fling themselves at the player from the very first moments, Infinite takes its time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Booker enters Colombia while its citizens are still at peace. After an eerie baptismal initiation (that arises again cleverly near the game’s conclusion), Booker emerges among the floating platforms of 1800’s Columbia, a city in the sky. Colombia’s people mill about as they prepare for a seemingly exciting annual event: the Raffle. There’s a carnival that gives the player access to Infinite’s various mechanics as a series of carnival games. Booker fires guns at cardboard cutouts of the Vox Populi, who at the time seem to be some sort of rebel gang terrorizing Colombia’s citizens. He tests out tonics, which give him magical abilities and control of the elements. He even sees a late game enemy on display as a carnival attraction. All the while, Columbia’s citizens chat and gossip, ask him questions and ignore him, eat cotton candy and peanuts, play with their children. It’s all very idyllic, with the clear undercurrent signaling some sort of coming upheaval, around which Booker’s story (and the player’s) will most certainly orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing too out-of-the-ordinary so far. We’ve got an intro, a tutorial section, and the makings of an inciting incident. It’s Gaming Plot Mechanics 101. However, unlike the first Bioshock, which introduces the player to combat through trial by fire (electrical shock, actually), Infinite continues with it’s raffle chatter and city gossip as Booker learns about vending machines, Colombia’s currency, health boosts and salts (mana) replenishers, about turret possession, and the mysterious energy that powers the city’s clockwork horse carriages. It’s all very immersive, richly detailed, and for me, downright fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all dreams end with the sleeper awakened. Colombia’s, Booker’s, and the player’s end when the tutorials and lore are exhausted, and the game’s (sometimes a little too obvious) god rays come shining down through the foliage around the Raffle stage. A crowd has gathered in anticipation, and Booker is just in time. He unsurprisingly wins the Raffle, and is presented with a choice: throw a baseball at the interracial couple who have appeared on stage (the crowd’s expected raffle reward) or to throw the ball at the announcer (the player’s rebellious option that implicitly aligns with the cultural norms of the game’s audience).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the choice, Booker is instantly recognized as the False Shepard of Colombia’s prophecies and the audience turns on a dime against him. Here’s where the face-ripping comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem, or brilliance depending on how you assess it, is that up to this point, the people of Colombia have seemed pleasant, polite, and good (if a bit snooty). Now, they’re clearly racist, which on its own is horrible. But does their racism merit tearing through them like so many gazelles in the lion’s jaws? Though, even that comparison would have a purpose, at least the lion eats the gazelles (not that Booker should resort to cannibalism).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may occur to some that the racists have now become enemies and thus fit under my “flies to the swatter” doctrine. Not so. In my previous examples, the Covenant are not peaceful, polite, irritatingly aristocratic ladies and gentlemen. They’re bloodthirsty, though sometimes comical, alien invaders. Ditto for the Helghast, who have their own weak attempts at humanization. Something about Colombia’s denizens is different. Something about Infinite is different. What is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrast. In most games, the desire to get immediately into the action drives the player into a frenzy of shoot, reload, shoot, reload, rest before having a chance to do much of anything else. Even a game like Mass Effect has clear interaction segments and clear combat segments. In Infinite, a peaceful crowd becomes a gruesomely slaughtered string of corpses in seconds. It happens fast, and it happens to NPC’s that before the attack are humanized from the very first moment. Never are even the guards seen as threatening or aggressive until Booker decides to throw the ball. Any more human and Ken Levine and his team might have convinced me to not even play their game at all. How’s that for “Would you kindly?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though contrast does a great deal of the work in setting up the strikingly violent moments after the Raffle, in my case, expectation did the rest. Quite a long time has passed, and a good many titles, since Bioshock (or even the forgettable Bioshock 2). Those games are both well-steeped in gore. Rapture, where the first two games are set, however, is already a bloody mess when the player character arrives. Compound those two details and the expectation is that the protagonist will be adding to the violence that preceded him. Colombia, on the other hand, is clean; we’re talking Disney clean. Everything glows or shines, the clothes are indicative of upper class and the trappings of financial excess. Not only that, but the opening includes no true combat tutorials (just the seemingly innocuous carnival games). Add that to the distance between titles, and a chance to forget just how gory the Bioshock games are, and you have the makings for a stomach churning moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bioshock’s Atlas reveal and the ensuing gameplay segment are powerful but ring of the M. Night Shyamalan school of pulling the rug out from under the audience. Infinite achieves something equally as interesting, if not more so. Under the right circumstances the game evokes an emotional and visceral (as in, gut-wrenching) response early enough that the player might reject the experience all together. And if not that, the observant player is forced to come to grips with Booker’s extremely aggressive tendency toward violence.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nathan Barham</name></author><summary type="html">Minor Spoilers for Bioshock Infinite’s opening section</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Ties that Band</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/education,/music/2013/03/24/The-Ties-that-Band.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Ties that Band" /><published>2013-03-24T09:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2013-03-24T09:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/education,/music/2013/03/24/The-Ties-that-Band</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/education,/music/2013/03/24/The-Ties-that-Band.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in &lt;a href=&quot;http://the-magazine.org&quot;&gt;The Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, Issue 8.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in November, I decided to try my luck with a pitch to The Magazine. I had an idea I thought would work well, and the experience to write the story. Glenn and Marco liked the idea. Here is the full article as it appeared in &lt;a href=&quot;http://the-magazine.org/8/the-ties-that-band&quot;&gt;Issue 8&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-ties-that-band&quot;&gt;The Ties That Band&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toby is struggling. In rehearsal after rehearsal, Toby can’t seem to pull it together. He’s not keeping his toes up, not keeping his back straight, not playing the right notes. It seems like a lot to remember, but he will have to achieve it all in order to march in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/user/prideofclarkston&quot;&gt;Pride of Clarkston Marching Band and Color Guard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staff takes turns following him from set to set, helping him count as he tries to play the music from memory; there are no music stands attached to instruments in a competition band. His shoulders slump, his instrument bell dips to one side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toby’s my project. There are always a few. As assistant director of the marching band, I need to help Toby (a composite of many students I’ve worked with) and all 70-some other marchers break through their difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“…17, 18, 19, 20!” I shout, as we near the next transition. In this move, Toby has to change direction from forward to backward. It sounds easy, but the body control required takes immense focus, especially for a 14-year-old high school freshman. Timing must be precise, with the size of each step measured and equal. Any variation can undermine the integrity of the drill design. The smallest error means judges take points off in the marching and maneuvering category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director Bill Legg stops the band, and I catch up with Toby. An iPhone glows in my hand with the drill set’s series of overlapping arcs. I point to Toby’s coordinate. “Did you see that?” I ask. “Twenty-four counts, prep, and go. You got that part right. Next time you have to keep playing. And keep your bell up. And smaller steps, so that you hit your mark.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do the move a few more times. The first is a disaster for Toby; now he’s thinking too hard. Music, step size, counting — it all falls apart. But we rehearse it again and again. The fourth time, it’s much better. His feet lock into position with the authority of a drill sergeant, and I cheer him on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s perfect. You nailed it that time!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toby grins. Yeah, it’s better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;band-ten-hut&quot;&gt;Band, Ten-Hut!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prideofclarkston.com/&quot;&gt;Pride of Clarkston&lt;/a&gt;, an 80-piece marching band from a small-town high school in southeastern Washington, has competed around the state for more than 30 years. Band traditions date back decades — more than a century for marching bands — but two years ago, ours took a decidedly modern turn. I began using my iPhone to manage drill-charts and count sequences. Now, iOS devices are the staff’s primary tools for recording, monitoring, tuning, and teaching the band’s students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the summer, the band retreats to Camp Wooten, a wooded site along the waters of the Tucannon River, where for 33 years the season’s first rehearsals have taken place. During a three-day stint at camp, the band learns how to march (it’s not just walking in time), how to find their coordinates (the precise locations in which they should stand to create legible shapes for the audience), and how to move between those points, all while playing an instrument and focusing their eyes on the stands rather than the ground beneath their feet. Some make an easy start of it, but most will stumble and recover. Nearly all come away with an invigorating sense of accomplishment and teamwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only three years ago, the Pride had a blanket “no cellphone” policy during rehearsals, be it during camp or back home. Screens meant distraction and disconnect from the unity of the group. Today, when the phones come out, they have a different purpose: They’re tools instead of toys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the summer retreat, the army of volunteers affectionately dubbed “the Band Parents” gets involved, too. Pacing up and down formations with iPads, iPods, and iPhones — and possibly some Android devices — parents and staff spend the day capturing clips of the Pride’s performers in action. Later, on the screen set up at the back of the tin-roofed mess hall, student after student marches past. Some are splendid examples and others not so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The band members watch with rapt attention as their digital selves glide over the field. They critique their own posture and execution while applauding newcomers to whom marching seems like second nature. At the next rehearsal, groups of students are on the field early, working to improve what they’ve seen in the video. Again the staff and parents film, and again the students watch, and again the band improves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;forward-glide&quot;&gt;Forward, Glide&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in Clarkston, I squint and angle the phone screen away from my face. It’s bright out, but I can still read the conversation. It’s from the Band Instructors Facebook group, where our preparations for rehearsal often begin. Everyone agrees: We have a &lt;em&gt;march-style&lt;/em&gt; problem to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March-style is the specific set of rules that the band uses to define how each member should traverse the field. For instance, Clarkston uses a rolled-toe forward march and an on-the-toes backward march. When a performer moves across the field, his or her shoulders must stay parallel to the sideline while feet point in the direction of travel — imagine a tank’s turret versus its tracks. Marchers’ posture must be straight-backed, with their weight forward and their instrument elevated so that they appear to be playing into the stadium press box instead of the sideline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All bands have a march-style problem; it’s part of learning the skill. However, this rehearsal has particular challenges. Not only do we have march style to fix, we have music memorization, musicality, choreography, and a lot of cleaning up to make sure that the shapes on the field look like arcs and lines instead of illegible blobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We break the rehearsal into blocks, deciding how much time we should spend on each technique as well as on each section of the show. The schedule goes into our smartphones so that each staff member has quick access to what will be happening next, and so we don’t get mired in any one section or technique. With the schedule finished, it’s out to the field for rehearsal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dress-set-dress&quot;&gt;Dress Set, Dress&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the three months following camp, the band learns an entire show, performs it in front of an audience or a panel of judges (or both), and then takes the critique back to the practice field to make improvements. The band’s staff members rely on phones and tablets and laptops to support almost every adjustment we make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the season, the band visits Auburn, Washington, for its final competition. After the daylong bus ride, the students scurry out at the Westfield Southcenter in Tukwila. From a seat in a newly opened burrito eatery, the staff adds one last iOS touch to an already heavy touchscreen season: a scavenger hunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a group-texting app, students exchange messages with the staff. First to take a photo of an item costing more than $100? A shot from the neighboring Guitar Center comes back. Okay, then. First photo of an item over $5000? A picture appears from the Smart car display in front of the food court. How about video of the most students doing the ballad choreography? Three videos pop out, one with the students in flying V formation and a conductor leading them. They lean and sway, slide and bow, click their heels, and sing the music as confused shoppers pass by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all in fun and brings the students together even when they are spread out across hundreds of thousands of square feet. The scavenger hunt  is what they’ll remember, but the staff knows the real reason for the texts: Every student must be with a group that has a smartphone. Almost all of them have one; those who don’t pair up with those who do. When it comes time to gather the scattered students, a text goes out. Everyone gets to the bus, and no one has to stand around waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope to find even more ways to use the technology, from sound mixing to rehearsal tracks to synthetic sounds. The Band Parents want to buy a high-quality audio system to bring Clarkston further into the modern era of marching band. Many schools already use electronic instruments in their pit percussion sections, and one or two of the Pride’s higher-division competitors even mix and sample sounds using iPads. When the new system arrives, there will be an iPad at the ready in Clarkston.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;band-dismissed&quot;&gt;Band, Dismissed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing their final competition performance of the year, the Pride exits the field with smiles on their faces and light in their eyes. One of the smiles is Toby’s. His step size was perfect, with his toes rolling on forward march and his heels high in backward march. He and the rest of the band have just performed the best version of the show to date, and they can feel it. The crowd can feel it, too. For the second time in three years, the Pride wins the Spirit of Auburn People’s Choice Award at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://auburnveteransday.webs.com&quot;&gt;Veterans Day Marching Band Championships&lt;/a&gt;. On the way to the photography area, students high-five and embrace in teary-eyed hugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they climb the bleachers, one voice rises from the group, singing a steady, muffled note. Another adds to the sound, and then another. Soon, the whole band is singing a major chord. One senior, the band’s drum major, sings the original note two octaves higher in a lilting falsetto. When the photographer cuts them off, the band grins back for the camera. Singing isn’t usually scored in marching band, but togetherness is. Smartphones still aren’t allowed in performance uniforms, and so the moment remains in memories alone. Some things were meant to stay analog.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nathan Barham</name></author><summary type="html">This article first appeared in The Magazine, Issue 8.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mass Effect’s Ending</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/gaming/2012/09/09/Mass-Effect's-Ending.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mass Effect's Ending" /><published>2012-09-09T03:57:00-07:00</published><updated>2012-09-09T03:57:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/gaming/2012/09/09/Mass-Effect's-Ending</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/gaming/2012/09/09/Mass-Effect's-Ending.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to understand Mass Effect’s conclusion, you have to start not at the beginning, but at the end, the very end. After the credits roll, an old man—and a child who appears to be his grandson—stand in a grove of trees looking out onto a spectacular night sky. The child listens in wonder as the grandfather finishes Mass Effect’s narrative, then asks if the grandfather will tell him another story about “the Shepherd.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In creating a series that spans hundreds of choices, a spectrum of &lt;em&gt;morality&lt;/em&gt; decisions, battles in which any number of characters can die, and various overall design adjustments, Mass Effect manages to finish with a coherent epilogue that encompasses all possible narrative conclusions. Beyond the color-coded final choice offered to Commander Shepard at the pinnacle of the transformed citadel-plus-crucible device, whether you played before or after the expanded ending, the Mass Effect universe ends the same: life goes on, and Commander Shepard was the key piece in deciding how that life would continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the grandfather epilogue provides a meaningful connection back to the single most-repeated word over the course of dozens of hours of gameplay: Shepard. Think about all the times you heard that name. Remember the YouTube videos that compiled characters saying it again and again. And whether it’s superficial or not, the connection to the epilogue’s Shepherd—the protector—cannot be taken for granted. &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; Commander Shepard would become was decided before the player even presses start at the first game’s opening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;But it takes away player agency at the last moment!&lt;/em&gt;” you cry. Perhaps it does, but weren’t you paying attention as all those hours of dialogue, cutscenes, and Codex entries rolled by? Races in the Mass Effect universe have only the illusion of choice. Everything goes back to the inevitable cycle which ends with the coming of the Reapers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;But I chose to wipe out all synthetics!&lt;/em&gt;” you say. That’s all well and good for you, but according to the narrative content (which you only ignore if you’re under the delusion that you are making the story, not experiencing a story authored by someone else) synthetic life will again reemerge when a technologically advanced race &lt;em&gt;invents it&lt;/em&gt;. So there it is, cyclical thinking, just as the game narrative has presented from day one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there other ways the designers could have concluded the trilogy, yes. Could the voice acting have been better in the epilogue, certainly. But it is the epilogue that finishes Mass Effect, not the choice of Commander Shepard (or the player). The series, it seems, strives to make two points concerning the end of its narrative. The first is that even in a veritable universe’s worth of decisions, all choices lead to the same eventual end. The second is that choice defines character, and character is more important than events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the grandfather tells the story to his grandson, when the events of Mass Effect have become tales from long ago, it is not &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; happened in the story that matters but &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nathan Barham</name></author><summary type="html">Spoilers</summary></entry></feed>
