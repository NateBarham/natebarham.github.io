And although the idea began with the Macintosh, the device closest to this particular Jobs ideal didn’t arrive in earnest until the iPhone.</p>

          </h1><p class="post-meta">Jul 18, 2014</p><p>When I’m not writing books, I spend my days teaching about them. One of my favorite courses each year is Creative Writing (obvious!). Every once in a while a student will ask how I go about my own writing. I’ve collected a few notes here to that effect. Following this list certainly doesn’t guarantee your writing will be good, or even that mine is. These are just some of the patterns I used to get from hundreds words to hundreds of thousands (Yes, <em>Fragments </em>is technically tens of thousands, 57,000 if you’re looking for any level of accuracy, but it’s not the only book, now is it?). Here they are.</p>

Beneath your feet, the ground shakes, jostling your view. Beyond the shrapnel and blurring vibrations, a trusted friend hangs on the edge of the precipice. Someone you’ve spent hours helping, training, and conversing with. At one point, it even seemed the two of you might have a romantic interest in one another, only to discover that you make a better team without the baggage of such entanglements. Now she hangs, fingers scraping helplessly through the debris of the collapsing environment, struggling for purchase. She’s saved your ass a hundred times; now it’s your turn.</p>

            There are Far Worse Terms Than Cinematic
          </a>
          </h1><p class="post-meta">Jun 8, 2012</p><p>What is a cinematic experience? For one, it’s a marketing term used on game boxes all the time. It conjures all sorts of images regarding action, intensity, and drama. That’s why they keep using it. A high rate of positive connotation is as good a reason as any for a marketer to repeatedly use a word or phrase. They want you to feel good about the purchase you’re about to make, and what better way than convincing the buyer that they will have a cinematic experience while playing the game?</p>

Beyond, three cameras, all of which will alert the rest of the security team. Crouching in the shadows between a row of shipping crates and traffic cones you weigh the options.</p>

          </h1><p class="post-meta">Apr 29, 2012</p><p>In the extensive <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/the-most-dangerous-gamer/8928/">piece on Jonathan Blow</a> for The Atlantic, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/taylor-clark/">Taylor Clark</a> explores more than any one commentary could possibly cover. If you want to get lost in scathing critique of the mainstream gaming industry for several thousand words, I encourage you to read it. Also, <em>Braid</em> spoilers abound, so proceed with caution if you haven’t played and/or finished it yet (I haven’t).</p>

            Who are Apple Stores for?
          </a>
          </h1><p class="post-meta">Apr 18, 2012</p><p>So let’s say that you’re an Apple fan. You’ve followed the company for years, watching keynote presentations the moment the link becomes available, obsessing over the most recent product rumors, even writing about the company on a regular basis. Now, let’s also say you find yourself with some extra time on your hands and one of the incredibly popular Apple Retail Stores nearby. Do you take the opportunity to go into the store and bask in the physical incarnation of the company in whose products you are so interested? Or do you instead, kick back with a cup of coffee at the Starbucks across the street?</p>
